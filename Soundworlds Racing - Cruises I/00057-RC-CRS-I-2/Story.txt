RC-CRS-I-2 | Sandtitan Tunnels

Second location named in Delfin’s ‘Cruise Location Diary’

“Sandtitan Tunnels: Huge tunnel-network left by ‘Sandtitans’ - goliath beetle-like machines created to survey and excavate rare minerals from beneath the Ourosian deserts. With enough reflex practice, the sudden fork-road decisions put you into a kind of meditative trance. Ending up in pits of sparkling gemstone is always a nice prize too.”
