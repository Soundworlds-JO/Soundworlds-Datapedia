Digital Commons Catalyst (DCC) License
[ No Cost Access - Source-Available - No Attribution - Share Alike ]

Subject to the below terms, all included project files and exported media in this repository are freely 
available to be used or studied, in part or whole. Copy-derivative works must be distributed under the 
conditions of this same license.  See the "PHILOSOPHY" section for the driving spirit behind these terms.


DEFINED TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
In the context of this license:

a)	the terms "artifact" or "artifacts" refer to copyright works and subject matter other than works, 
	including digital media, code, and/or project files the subject matter of this license;

b)	the terms "copy-derivative" or "copy-derived" refer to any artifact created by the licensee 
	containing whole or sections copied, derived, modified or adapted from artifacts subject to the terms of 
	this license, or created using included tools (but does not include knowledge gained from the study of 
	those artifacts, then applied in an otherwise original work, invention or other intellectual property asset);

c)	the terms "No Cost", "No Cost Access" and "No Financial Cost" do not include the cost of access to 
	a computer and unrestricted internet.


LICENSE
You may study, use, adapt and/or modify what you find in the artifacts for use in your own copy-derivative works, 
subject to the following license terms:

1) 	NO COST ACCESS: If distributing, publishing, disseminating, sharing or otherwise communicating to the public a 
	copy-derivative, any such copy-derivatives  must be made clearly accessible and permitted to be studied, used, 
	adapted and/or modified by the public (on an anonymous basis ) at no financial cost, including by being free from 
	mandatory account creation or pay walls.

2) 	SOURCE-AVAILABLE: Project/source files generated by you in the process of creating (and directly relevant to) 
	copy-derivates must also be included in any release of the copy-derivatives so that licensees may effectively 
	utilise their rights in the copy-derivatives as granted under the terms of this license.

3) 	NO ATTRIBUTION: No credit/attribution is required to be given to any original authors for copy-derivative works. 
	To the extent required under applicable laws to give effect to this clause 3, you waive your moral rights subsisting 
	in any such copy-derivative work, and warrant that you have obtained sufficient waivers from all other relevant 
	authors in the associated copy-derivative work.

4) 	SHARE ALIKE: You may publish or distribute your own works copy-derived from the artifacts, on the condition that 
	the entirety of the copy-derivative works are distributed under this same license. A copy of the terms of this 
	license must be included, accessible and clearly marked in your copy-derivative work.

5) 	The artifacts are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited 
	to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the 
	authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, 
	tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the artifacts or the use or other dealings in the artifacts.


CLARIFICATIONS
i) "No Cost Access" does not mean non-commercial. Copy-derivative works may be used within a commercial platform, 
or made available on a commercial basis in conjunction with the no cost access distribution method. However, at 
all times that the licensee makes the copy-derivative work available on a commercial (paid) basis, there must be a 
clear no-financial-cost option to accessing ALL included artifacts for the general public (and not requiring a 
user account for access). Any distribution, publication, dissemination or communication to the public of a paid 
and/or account version of a copy-derivative work must include these license terms to make it clear that a no-cost 
option is available.

	Example 1: a copy-derivative product may be published to video or audio streaming website even if that 
		streaming website has an option for a paid subscription, ONLY IF the general public also has a clear option to, 
		AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the copy-derivative product and artifacts under this same license. If the 
		website requires an account to access the product, it is not compatible with this license.

	Example 2: a copy-derivative product may be distributed through a "pay-what-you-want" model, given that 
		the minimum price is free / no-cost, and access is given to all included project files and artifacts. 

	Example 3: The artifacts under this license may be used in a marketing campaign for a commercial product, 
		ONLY IF the general public is presented with a clear option to, AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the 
		copy-derivative marketing product and artifacts under this same license.

	Example 4: a copy-derivative product may be used as part of a live performance with paid tickets, however it
		must be made clear before purchase of paid ticket that all associated digital artifacts are also available and usable 
		AT NO FINANCIAL COST, and covered by this same license (and by providing access to these artifacts).

ii) The term "copy-derivative" is used rather than "derivative" to emphasise that the study and application of 
knowledge gained from included artifacts is not restricted by this license. Directly copied code or artifacts, 
however, are restricted by the license.

	Example 1: A person who learns about the general structure of an algorithm from a project or source code 
		file under this license can then implement that same general algorithm in their own project - commercial or not. 
		However, if that person copies code or files directly from artifacts included under this license, they must use this 
		same license when redistributing. 

	Example 2: Algorithms, techniques or other patterns in included artifacts can be used in an educational 
		environment. Students can then use these same patterns in their own works, under any other license. If those students 
		copy code or artifacts directly from included artifacts, they must use this same license when redistributing.

	Example 3: A musical score included as an artifact can be studied and analysed. A new musical score created, 
		inspired by the included score, does not have to be licensed under this license. However, if large sections of the 
		original score are copied and "quoted" or if recorded audio samples of the original piece are used in producing the 
		new work, this new work will need to be licensed under this same license.

	Example 4: If a person uses an included tool to generate a new creative work, that resultant creative work 
		(and associated project files), if distributed, will need to be distributed under this same license.


PHILOSOPHY
[Please note that this section, titled “PHILOSOPHY”, does not constitute legally binding terms or restrictions of 
the license above, but further explanation to the “spirit” of this license. It must, however, be included and 
unaltered as part of the license in copy-derivative distributions.]

No matter how many people - individuals, small groups, or culture-wide movements - adopt and pass this license on, 
the general public benefits from a growing pool of culture, tools, and resources to access and study at no financial cost. 
This empowers people, no matter their socioeconomic situation. The conditions placed by this license for copy-derivatives 
are designed as a mechanism and a catalyst to grow and spread this freely available pool of resources.

	NO COST ACCESS: This license was created in the spirit of increasing the pool of culture, tools and resources 
		in the digital public commons. Its key point of difference from many other open source or source-available licenses 
		to prevent cost-prohibitive access to any of its included artifacts and source.

	SOURCE-AVAILABLE: If the design mechanics behind all technologies and cultural creations were transparent 
		and commonly shareable, learning and innovation would accelerate at an incredible rate. While this is an ideal, 
		following and sharing this license contributes to this directly. 

	NO ATTRIBUTION: One key difference to other commons-oriented licenses is the lack of requirement for 
		attribution to any original authors. There are a number of ethical and practical reasons for separating art from 
		the artist, a creation from its creator, or an idea from its thinker. At its core, this will let the artifact be 
		judged and used on its own merit, rather than a perception of who it came from. This "non-restriction" is made 
		explicit to counter the assumption of attribution required.

	SHARE ALIKE: The Share Alike clause, requiring usage of this same license, is used to prevent copy-derivative
 		products from simply taking these artifacts and putting a price on them, which would subvert the mission of this license.
