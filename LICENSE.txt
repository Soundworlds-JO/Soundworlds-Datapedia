License: No Cost Access - Open Source - No Attribution - Share Alike (NCA-OS-NA-SA)

All included project files and exported media in this repository are available to be used, studied, and copy-derivative works created under this license.

Terms:
a) In the context of this license, the term "artifact" or "artifacts" refer to digital media, code, and/or project files included under this license.
b) In the context of this license, the term "copy-derivative" or "copy-derived" refers to any works created containing whole or sections copied from included artifacts, or created using included tools. Knowledge gained from the study of included artifacts, then applied in a new creation, is not bound by the limitations of this license.
c) In the context of this license, the terms "No Cost", "No Cost Access" and "No Financial Cost" does not include the cost of access to a computer and unrestricted internet.

Conditions:
1) You can study, use, and/or change what you find in the included artifacts for use in your own copy-derivative works, under the following conditions:
2) NO COST ACCESS: If distributing a copy-derivative, all included artifacts must be made clearly available to be studied, used, or changed as a no financial cost option for public access (the cost of computer and unrestricted internet access is not counted in this). If the only clear option for access to included artifacts are through paid option(s), or if access to these artifacts requires an account, it is considered a breach of this license.
3) OPEN SOURCE: Project/source files generated by you in the process of creating (and in direct relation of) included media must be included in the distributed release so that users may study, use, or change the project contents.
4) NO ATTRIBUTION: No credit/attribution is required to be given to any original authors for copy-derivative works.
5) SHARE ALIKE: You can publish or distribute your own works copy-derived from the included artifacts, given that copy-derivative works are distributed under this same license. A copy of this license must be included in your copy-derivative work.
6) The included artifacts are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the included artifacts or the use or other dealings in the included artifacts.

Clarifications:
i) "No Cost Access" does not mean non-commercial. The included artifacts may be used within a commercial platform, or a paid option can exist. However, there must be a clear no-financial-cost option to accessing ALL included artifacts for the general public (and not requiring a user account for access). A paid and/or account version of this copy-derivative product must also be distributed with this same license to make it clear that a no-cost option is available.
	Example 1: a copy-derivative product may be published to video or audio streaming website even if that streaming website has an option for a paid subscription, ONLY IF the general public also has a clear option to, AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the copy-derivative product and artifacts under this same license.
	Example 2: a copy-derivative product may be distributed through a "pay-what-you-want" model, given that the minimum price is free / no-cost, and access is given to all included project files and artifacts. 
	Example 3: The artifacts under this license may be used in a marketing campaign for a commercial product, ONLY IF the general public is presented with a clear option to, AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the copy-derivative marketing product and artifacts under this same license.
	Example 4: a copy-derivative product may be used as part of a live performance with paid tickets, however it must be made clear before purchase of paid ticket that all associated digital artifacts are also available and usable AT NO FINANCIAL COST, and covered by this same license (and by providing access to these artifacts).
ii) The term "copy-derivative" is used rather than "derivative" to emphasise that the study and application of knowledge gained from included artifacts is not restricted by this license. Directly copied code or artifacts, however, are restricted by the license.
	Example 1: A person who learns about the general structure of an algorithm from a project or source code file under this license can go on to implement that same general algorithm in their own project - commercial or not. However, if that person copies code or files directly from artifacts included under this license, they must use this same license when redistributing. 
	Example 2: Algorithms, techniques or other patterns in included artifacts can be used in an educational environment. Students can then use these same patterns in their own works, under any other license. If those students copy code or artifacts directly from included artifacts, they must use this same license when redistributing.
	Example 3: A musical score included as an artifact can be studied and analyzed. A new musical score created, inspired by the included score, does not have to be licensed under this license. However, if large sections of the original score are copied and "quoted" or if recorded audio samples of the original piece are used in producing the new work, this new work will need to be licensed under this license.

Philosophy:
[Please note that this section, titled “Philosophy”, does not constitute legal restrictions, but further explanation to the “spirit” of this license. It must, however, be included and unaltered as part of the license in copy-derivative distributions.]
NO COST ACCESS: This license was created in the spirit of increasing the pool of culture, tools and resources in the digital public commons. Its key point of difference from many other open source licenses to prevent cost-prohibitive access to any of its included artifacts and source (which has been seen in other open source projects).
OPEN SOURCE: If the design mechanics behind all technologies and cultural creations were transparent and commonly shareable, learning and innovation would accelerate at an incredible rate. While this is an ideal, following and sharing this license contributes to this exponentially. 
NO ATTRIBUTION: One key difference to other commons-oriented licenses is the lack of requirement for attribution to any original authors. There are a number of ethical and practical reasons for separating art from the artist, a creation from its creator, or an idea from its thinker. At its core, this will let the artifact be judged and used on its own merit, rather than a perception of who it came from. This "non-restriction" is made explicit to counter the assumption of attribution required.
SHARE ALIKE: The Share Alike clause, requiring usage of this same license, is used to prevent copy-derivative products from simply taking these artifacts and putting a price on them, which would subvert the mission of this license.

The more we can remove the financial and other barriers from access to tools, source, learning, and culture, the more we can empower people humanity-wide regardless of socioeconomic situation. Cheap technology, culture, and education are great. No-cost and publicly-available technology, culture, and education are the ideal. This is what this license aims to empower and spread.
